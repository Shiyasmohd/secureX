SecureX is a blockchain-based evidence management system to prevent manipulation in Indian courts.

This Decentralized Application can be used to upload evidence by users against any case number. As blockchain technology is used, 
the data cannot be changed after it has been successfully uploaded to the blockchain network. This creates a digital trail from the collection of evidence at the crime scene, all the way to court.

## Why we made SecureX‚ùì

A lot of evidence is manipulated in Courts, and innocent people are sued as a result of this. 
The court must rely on all of the intermediaries that stand between the collection and the submission of evidence. 
We are trying to alleviate the problems the traditional chain of custody has, 
including loss of evidence, theft, tampering, and worse, manipulation of evidence within the evidence management system. <br>

If we fail to correct this systemic problem within our criminal justice system, we will all suffer the loss of many hard-working, honest, and falsely accused people who might have been excellent Police Officers, or the next great Doctor, Lawyer, Researcher, or Inventor. We simply can‚Äôt afford not to change,
and blockchain in the supply chain of evidence is the change we need to implement.
