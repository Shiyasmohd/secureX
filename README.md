SecureX is a blockchain-based evidence management system to prevent manipulation in Indian courts.

This Decentralized Application can be used to upload evidence by users against any case number. As blockchain technology is used, 
the data cannot be changed after it has been successfully uploaded to the blockchain network. This creates a digital trail from the collection of evidence at the crime scene, all the way to court.

## Why we made SecureX‚ùì

A lot of evidence is manipulated in Courts, and innocent people are sued as a result of this. 
The court must rely on all of the intermediaries that stand between the collection and the submission of evidence. 
We are trying to alleviate the problems the traditional chain of custody has, 
including loss of evidence, theft, tampering, and worse, manipulation of evidence within the evidence management system. <br>

If we fail to correct this systemic problem within our criminal justice system, we will all suffer the loss of many hard-working, honest, and falsely accused people who might have been excellent Police Officers, or the next great Doctor, Lawyer, Researcher, or Inventor. We simply can‚Äôt afford not to change,
and blockchain in the supply chain of evidence is the change we need to implement.

## Getting started üèÅ

Wanna know more? See the demo video [here][video link].


## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

The projects requires NodeJS and npm to work. Instructions to install all other dependencies are given below.
> Note: The instructions given below are for Linux (specifically Ubuntu 18.04). You should be able to find similar instructions for MacOS and Windows. Although support is available for Windows, I recommend using Linux or MacOS. Windows has some difficulty playing with npm.

### Node modules

1. Move to the project directory and open it in your terminal.
2. Run `npm install`.

### Ganache

1. Go to [Ganache homepage](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) and download. 
2. If you are on Linux, you must have received an _.appimage_ file. Follow installation instructions available [here.](https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/)

### IPFS

1. Go to the [download page](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/) of IPFS and follow the instructions given.

### Local server

1. You can use any local server to deploy the web application.
2. I used PHP but feel free to choose anything of your liking.
3. To install PHP on your Linux machine, run `sudo apt-get install php`. Detailed instructions available [here.](https://thishosting.rocks/install-php-on-ubuntu/)
4. One more great option is lite-server which is available as a node module.
5. Install lite-server by running the following command on your terminal `npm install -g lite-server`

### Metamask

1. Metamask is a browser extension available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Brave Browser.
2. Go to the this [link](http://metamask.io/) and add Metamask to your browser.

## Getting the dApp running


#### 1. Ganache
  - Open Ganache and click on settings in the top right corner.
  - Under **Server** tab:
    - Set Hostname to 127.0.0.1 -lo
    - Set Port Number to 8545
    - Enable Automine
  - Under **Accounts & Keys** tab:
    - Enable Autogenerate HD Mnemonic

#### 2. IPFS
  - Fire up your terminal and run `ipfs init`
  - Then run 
    ```
    ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin "['*']"
    ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "['true']"
    ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods "['PUT', 'POST', 'GET']"
    ```
#### 3. Metamask
  - After installing Metamask, click on the metamask icon on your browser.
  - Click on __TRY IT NOW__, if there is an announcement saying a new version of Metamask is available.
  - Click on continue and accept all the terms and conditions after reading them.
  - Stop when Metamask asks you to create a new password. We will come back to this after deploying the contract in the next section.
  
### Deploying the contract

I purposely haven't used any development framework so as to keep the code as raw as possible. This will also be easier to understand for any newcomer who is already having a tough time understanding the many technologies the application is built on.

#### 1. Starting your local development blockchain
  - Open Ganache.
  - Make sure to configure it the way mentioned above.
  
Moving on, to deploy the contract on the blockchain you have two options:
  - Use any available development framework for dApps. I recommend the [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) framework. [Embark](https://embark.status.im/) is another great alternative.
  - Go full on geek mode and deploy it yourself with a few lines of code.

I'll be explaining the second method here.

#### 2. Deploying the contract and linking it to the frontend
  - Fire up your terminal and move to the project directory
  - Now open up `/YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/src/js/run.js` in your favourite text editor
  - You have to make two changes:
    1. Make sure the address in line number 3 is the same as your RPC server address on Ganache.
    If you have configured Ganache as instructed above, the code should look like this:
    
    ```
    var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
    ```
    2. The path in this line should point to where your solidity contract is located:
    
    ```
    var code = fs.readFileSync('/YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/contracts/Agent.sol').toString();
    ```
  - Go back to your terminal, type `node` and hit enter
  - Copy and paste all the contents of `run.js` to the terminal
  - If all goes well, you should see some few lines as output of the command
    ```
    console.log(compiledCode.contracts[':Agent'].interface);
    ```
  - This is the ABI of the contract, copy and paste these lines in line number 10 of `app.js`. The code should look like:
    ``` 
    abi = JSON.parse('PASTE_YOUR_ABI_HERE')
    ```
  - Go back to the terminal and type `deployedContract.address;`, which is also the last command of your `run.js` file. The     output is the address where the contract is deployed on the blockchain.
  - Copy the output and paste it on line number 13 of `app.js`. The code should look like:
    ```
    contractInstance = AgentContract.at('PASTE_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE');
    ```
  - That's it for this part. Now lets set up Metamask.
  
### Running the dApp

#### 1. Connecting Metamask to our local blockchain
  - Let's go back to the configuration section of Metamask.
  - If done correctly, you would have stopped at the part where Metamask asks you to create a new password.
  - Just below the __CREATE__ button, click on the __Import with seed phrase__.
  - A form should open up, asking you to enter __Wallet Seed__.
  - Open Ganache, copy the twelve words that make up the __MNEMONIC__ on the __ACCOUNTS__ tab. 
  - Paste the twelve words in __Wallet Seed__. Create a new password and click __IMPORT__.

#### 2. Starting IPFS 
  - Open a new terminal window.
  - Make sure you have configured IPFS as mentioned above.
  - Run `ipfs daemon`.
  
#### 3. Start a local server
  - Open a new terminal window and navigate to `/YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/src/`.
  - Run `php -S locahost:3000`.
  - Open `localhost:3000/register.html` on your browser.
  - That's it! The dApp is up and running locally.
